# About

Welcome to **R.I.N.G. (Radially Integrated Nexus Guardian)**!

In R.I.N.G., you control a droid whose job it is to escort your civilization's Nexus through space, protecting it from an onslaught of asteroids.

# Controls

**WASD**: Move control droid in and out, or around, the rings.

**Arrow Keys**: Change selected ring with up/down, rotate the selected ring with left/right.

**E**: Place a turret at the droid's current location. Turrets cost 50 scrap metal and cannot be placed on top of other structures. Turrets die in one hit from any asteroid, dealing no damage in return.

**R**: Place a wall at the droid's current location. Walls cost 100 scrap metal and cannot be placed on top of other structures. A wall will absorb damage from incoming asteroids, and destroy them if it survives.

**Space**: Fire all your turrets. Hold to fire continuously; can't fire faster than 5 times per second.

**Escape**: Exit the game.

# Strategy

- Always make sure you have enough turrets to farm more scrap metal before building
- Place turrets on different rings to aim at multiple targets independently
- Place your walls to protect your turrets instead of as a last line of defense
- Walls are powerful early, but are generally worse long-term investments
- Inner rings are more maneuverable, but are on the trajectory of more asteroids
